# We Are

We are is a Ruby/Sinatra-based web application where users can login, create and share items with properties: make a blog, make a list, make a virtual wardrobe!

Sign up and click the create button to make a new item. Set sharing to 'edit' to make your item available for edit by the We Are community, or set to 'view' to make it available to the public at large.

The 'Home' link ('/users' route) lists the current We Are users and items they have made public and/or shared.
'My Page' ('/users/username') will display the current user's items made available for editing.
Individual items and properties are routed via '/items/item_id' and '/properties/property_id'

Install: the app is a complete ruby directory. You can run it locally using the 'shotgun' gem, for example, or deploy it to a ruby hosting environment.
